# Quark

> Boilerplate for Electron applications built with typescript

## What can it do

Quark gives you a boilerplate to an Electron application built with typescript, up and running quickly.

## Features

- Great starting place for those who want to try Electron, but use the superpowers of Typescript
- Compiles TS to ES6 (can be configured in tsconfig)
- Uses plain HTML & CSS, but can be set up to add front-end frameworks
- Open Source and always free

## Install

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Electron](http://electronjs.org/) installed.

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/SunstroUS/quark.git
> cd quark
> npm install
> npm run start
```

## Dev

Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org).

### Commands:

- `npm run start` : Compiles the type and runs the application
- `npm run compile-type` : Compiles just the type without starting the application
