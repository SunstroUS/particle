# Particle

> Application to easily generate particles on your desktop.

## What can it do

Particle was made to give extra functionality on your desktop. Kind of like the accessibility button on iOS devices. Current problem is that electron doesn't have good way to manage click through areas. Might mitigate this by rengerating new browser windows, but not sure yet. For now this project is on hold.

## Install

\*Currently this is still in beta/development and can only be installed by cloning the repo and manually installing it.

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/SunstroUS/particle.git
> cd particle
> npm install
> npm run start
```
